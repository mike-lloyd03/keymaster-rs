# KeyMaster
## Key Inventory Manager

Thing for keeping track of who has what keys.

This is a Rust rewrite of [KeyMaster]() which I wrote in Python a few years ago. The purpose of this project is to gain more experience developing in Rust as well as learning some core Rust crates.

## Current Plan
### Backend
Develop a REST API which connects to a Postgres database for managing all the CRUD operations.

Crates:
- `sqlx` For database connection
- `actix-web` For backend web server and routing

### Frontend
Develop a responsive BLAZINGLY FAST front end using modern technologies like web-assembly.

Crates:
- `yew` It's like React but on Rust steriods


## Will I Ever Get There?
I don't know.
